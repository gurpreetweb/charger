                Updated: July 1, 2020</p>
                
               <p> Illumeet values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will help you understand how we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use of our online facilities and services, and what we will and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and created to ensure our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet but to exceed most existing privacy standards.</p> 
                
                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time Illumeet decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner.
                </p> 
                <p>This Policy applies to Illumeet, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. Through the use of https://illumeet.com, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy.
                </p> 
              <p> Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that Illumeet does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of, and share the information collected.
            </p> 
                <h3>Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following:</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website;</li>
                <li>Why we collect personally identifiable information and the legal basis for such collection;</li>
                <li>How we use the collected information and with whom it may be shared;</li>
                <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and</li>
                <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
               </ul> 
                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. This website collects various types of information, such as:
                </p>
                <p>Information automatically collected when visiting our website, which may include cookies, third party tracking technologies, and server logs.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, Illumeet may, on occasion, collect non-personal anonymous demographic information, such as age, gender, household income, political affiliation, race and religion, as well as the type of browser you are using, IP address, or type of operating system, which will assist us in providing and maintaining superior quality service.
                </p>
                <p>Illumeet may also deem it necessary, from time to time, to follow websites that our users may frequent to glean types of services and products most popular to customers or the general public.
                </p>
                <h2>Why We Collect Information and For How Long</h2>

            </ul>

            </ul>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                
                <p>Illumeet takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of the user's personal information under our control.
                </p>
                <p>The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build users' trust and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and communication of credit card and personal information. In addition, Illumeet is a licensee of TRUSTe. The website is also secured by VeriSign.
